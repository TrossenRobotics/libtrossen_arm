// Purpose:
// This script demonstrates how to set the manual IP address in the EEPROM.
//
// Hardware setup:
// 1. A WXAI V0 arm with leader end effector and ip at 192.168.1.2
//
// The script does the following:
// 1. Initializes the driver
// 2. Configures the driver with the follower configuration
// 3. Sets the IP address of the robot
// 4. The driver cleans up automatically at the destructor
// 5. Power cycle to apply the new IP address

#include <iostream>

#include "libtrossen_arm/trossen_arm.hpp"

int main() {
  // Initialize the driver
  trossen_arm::TrossenArmDriver driver;

  // Configure the driver
  driver.configure(
    trossen_arm::Model::wxai_v0,
    trossen_arm::StandardEndEffector::wxai_v0_leader,
    "192.168.1.2",
    false
  );

  // Print the current IP address
  std::cout << "Current IP address: " << driver.get_manual_ip() << std::endl;

  // Set the IP address of the robot to 192.168.1.2
  driver.set_manual_ip("192.168.1.2");

  // Print the new IP address
  std::cout << "New IP address: " << driver.get_manual_ip() << std::endl;

  // Power cycle to apply the new IP address
  std::cout << "Power cycle the robot to apply the new IP address." << std::endl;

  return 0;
